# weapon_shop
Small PHP program that loads "weapon shop" inventory using .csv and displays stats.

This was part of an assignment in CIS195 (week 4) that uses forms and loads data from a CSV file and allows user to select a weapon to see its attributes and cost.

You can see this "app" online at: https://urifrazier.com/weapon_shop/main.php
